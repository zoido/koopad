Experiments: from hello world to whatever it's end up.

Eventual goal is to to have a collaborative online plain-text editor, however
this experiment is more about the journey than the goal.
I am trying to play with technologies I would not use normally. So I have
chosen the stack and now I'd kike to know what I am able to do with it.
Whole life cycle tooling should be wired in as soon as possible.

## Stack:

 * java
 * dagger + producers
 * grpc
 * dart for front-end
